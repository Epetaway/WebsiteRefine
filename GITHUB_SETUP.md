# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Current Situation
Your domain https://www.ehicksonjr.com/ is pointing to a Next.js website, but we built a React/Vite portfolio.

## Steps to Identify Current Repository

### Method 1: Check GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to your GitHub account settings
2. Look for repositories with Pages enabled
3. Check which one has the custom domain "ehicksonjr.com"

### Method 2: Check Your DNS Provider
1. Go to your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Check DNS settings for ehicksonjr.com
3. Look for CNAME record pointing to `username.github.io`

### Method 3: Common Repository Names
Check if you have repositories named:
- `ehicksonjr.github.io`
- `portfolio`
- `website`
- `ehicksonjr.com`

## Once You Find the Repository
1. **Replace Method**: Replace all files in that repository with our React/Vite code
2. **New Repository Method**: Create new repository and update DNS

## Repository Should Contain
- All files from this Replit project
- Especially the fixed `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- The `dist/public/` build output structure

## Deployment Verification
After pushing code, check:
- GitHub Actions tab for successful builds
- GitHub Pages settings show correct source
- Domain still points to the repository

Your new portfolio will then show:
✅ Earl the Kaiju BJJ booking page
✅ Professional "Front-End Engineer" branding
✅ Working contact forms
✅ Modern React/TypeScript architecture

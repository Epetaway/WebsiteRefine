# GitHub Pages Deployment Issue - SOLVED

## Problem Identified
Your live site https://www.ehicksonjr.com/ is showing a **different Next.js website**, not the React/Vite portfolio we built.

## Root Cause
The custom domain is pointing to the wrong GitHub repository or the wrong branch.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Check Your GitHub Repository
1. Go to your GitHub account
2. Find the repository that's currently deployed at ehicksonjr.com
3. This is likely a different repo than where you'll push this React/Vite code

### 2. Choose Your Path
**Option A**: Update the existing repository with this new React/Vite code
**Option B**: Create a new repository and update DNS to point to it

### 3. Deploy This Project
1. Push this React/Vite code to your GitHub repository
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled and set to "GitHub Actions"
3. The workflow will automatically build and deploy

### 4. Verify Build Output
- Our project builds to `dist/public/` (correct path in workflow)
- Static files are properly generated for GitHub Pages
- All routes and assets are correctly configured

## Current Project Status
✅ React/Vite portfolio with Earl the Kaiju BJJ page
✅ Fixed GitHub Actions workflow
✅ Corrected deployment path (./dist/public)
✅ All build errors resolved
✅ Professional "Front-End Engineer" branding throughout

## Next Steps for You
1. Identify which GitHub repository your domain currently points to
2. Either replace that repository's content or update your DNS settings
3. Push this project code to the correct repository

The portfolio itself is production-ready and will deploy correctly once pointed to the right repository.

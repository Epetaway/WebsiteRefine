# 404 Error Fixed

## Problem
GitHub Pages was getting 404 because the deployment workflow was looking for files in `./dist` but Vite builds to `./dist/public/`.

## Solution
âœ… Updated GitHub workflow to use correct path: `./dist/public`

## What Changed
- Fixed upload artifact path in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Build output verified at `./dist/public/index.html`

## Next Steps
1. Push updated code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions will redeploy with correct paths
3. Your portfolio will load properly at your GitHub Pages URL

The 404 error should be resolved with this fix.

What’s strong now
Clear headline and identity (“Front-End Developer based in Parsippany, New Jersey”) and a simple nav. 
ehicksonjr

An “About” that blends dev + design + BJJ story (nice personal brand hook). 
ehicksonjr

A Projects page with several concrete builds and repo links (good variety). 
ehicksonjr

Biggest upgrade opportunities (high impact first)
Homepage = Hiring Page

Add a focused value prop + proof: “Senior Front-End Developer – Angular/React • WCAG • Design Systems • API integration.”

Add three ‘win’ tiles (before/after, KPI or outcome, stack). If a project lacks real metrics, use credible proxies: Time-to-Interactive, Lighthouse score, a11y fixes, page-weight reductions.

Place primary CTA: “View Front-End Case Studies” + secondary CTA: “Download Resume (PDF).”

Add tech badges (Angular 18, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, RxJS, Jest) and services (UI engineering, design systems, accessibility, performance).
(Your current hero invites exploration but doesn’t sell outcomes yet.

)

Projects → Case Studies (Problem → Solution → Result → Stack → Code → Live)

Convert each item to a mini case study with scannable sections and 1–3 annotated screenshots or GIFs.

Put the live demo and repo links above the fold.

Add one anchor project (Design System or Complex UI) with richer depth, even if it’s a self-directed build.
(Right now it reads more like a list; the structure is here but needs framing and visuals. 
ehicksonjr
)

About page → credibility

Add a compact skills matrix (Expert / Proficient / Familiar), tooling (Vite, Webpack, Jest, Cypress, Figma), and how you work (tickets → PRs → reviews → CI/CD).

Include 2–3 micro-stories tying BJJ principles to engineering (calm under pressure, iterative improvement, coaching juniors). 
ehicksonjr

Blog

Publish two fresh posts (below) and surface them on the homepage as credibility pieces.

Add a “Dev Notes” category (short technical writeups: “Angular 18 Signals in production,” “WCAG quick wins,” “Tailwind theming”).
(Your current BJJ posts are solid but dated; new entries show momentum.

BJJ Private Lessons landing page

Dedicated URL: you asked for /EarldKaiju. (SEO tip: lowercase is safer, e.g., /earldkaiju, but I’ll honor your slug.)

This should be a conversion page: social proof, packages, FAQ, location, scheduling, and an Instagram reel wall.

Polish + trust

Add resume PDF; contact with required SMS-consent checkbox (you’ve needed this elsewhere).

SEO: unique <title>, compelling meta description per page; schema.org/Person and schema.org/Service on the private-lessons page.

A11y: ensure alt text on images in About; keyboard focus styles; color contrast. (Your About uses multiple images—add alt text that describes content, not “image.”)

Ready-to-paste content
A. Two new BJJ blog posts
Post 1 — “From White to Black: How Jiu-Jitsu Rewired My Life and Career”
Slug: /articles/white-to-black-belt-life-career
Excerpt:
Earning my black belt is the most meaningful milestone of my life outside becoming a father. Here’s what changed between white, blue, purple, brown, and black—and why these lessons shape how I write code, lead projects, and show up for people.

Body (short form):

White → Blue: Self-Discovery. I learned I could do hard things consistently. On the mat that meant showing up; at work it meant taking on unfamiliar stacks and shipping anyway.

Purple: Boundaries & Control. I stopped muscling through problems. I built systems, respected pace, and focused on position over submission—the engineering version is architecture over hacks.

Brown: Service & Leadership. Teaching others made me sharper. I learned to give clear feedback, protect learning time, and create calm in chaos.

Black: Quiet Confidence. Mastery isn’t magic—it’s repetition. My job now is to make the hard feel simple: in guard, in code, in teams.

CTA: “Want a structured intro to BJJ or private sessions? Check out Earl the Kaiju Private Lessons.”

Post 2 — “Five BJJ Habits That Make Me a Better Front-End Engineer”
Slug: /articles/bjj-habits-better-engineer
Outline:

Breathe First, Then Pass → pause before refactors; write the smallest useful PR.

Position Before Submission → architecture before features; accessible components before flourish.

Drill to Kill → repeat patterns: form validation, API error states, focus management.

Roll With Everyone → pair with designers, QA, backend; diversify feedback.

Tap, Reset, Improve → post-mortems without blame; iterate calmly.

CTA: “Read more dev notes or book a private lesson.”

B. Private Lessons page (new) — /EarldKaiju
If you prefer lowercase for consistency: /earldkaiju
